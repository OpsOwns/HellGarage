# Hell Garage App - Backend Overview

## Description

Welcome to the Hell Garage Backend repository! This backend is designed to support the Hell Garage App, a project that follows the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and is implemented using .NET 8. The project also adheres to best practices, including the use of the Unit of Work pattern to ensure data consistency.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET 8:** The backend is built on the .NET 8 framework, leveraging its latest features and improvements.

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** The project follows the principles of DDD to model the domain and structure the codebase in a way that reflects the business logic.

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** CQRS is employed to separate the command and query responsibilities, optimizing the system for reads and writes independently.

## Key Features

1. **Domain Models:** The backend includes well-defined domain models that represent the core entities and their relationships within the Hell Garage domain.

2. **Commands and Queries:** Commands are used to perform write operations, while queries handle read operations. This separation ensures a clear distinction between actions that modify the system state and those that retrieve information.

3. **Repositories:** The project includes repositories that implement the Unit of Work pattern. This ensures that multiple operations are performed atomically, maintaining data consistency.

4. **Dependency Injection:** The backend uses dependency injection to manage the components and their dependencies, promoting modularity and testability.

5. **RESTful API:** The backend provides a RESTful API to interact with the system from the client side.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the Hell Garage Backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hell-garage-backend.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd hell-garage-backend
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

This will start the Hell Garage Backend, and it will be ready to handle requests from the Hell Garage App.

Feel free to explore the codebase, and make sure to refer to the documentation for specific details on how to use the API and integrate it with the Hell Garage App frontend.
